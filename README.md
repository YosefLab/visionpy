# Functional Interpretation for <br/> scRNA-seq Data

NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT YET READY FOR USE.

This is a Python port of the VISION [R package](https://github.com/yoseflab/vision). VISION aids in the interpretation of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data by selecting for gene signatures which describe coordinated variation between cells. While the software only requires an expression matrix and a signature library (available in online databases), it is also designed to integrate into existing scRNA-seq analysis pipelines by taking advantage of precomputed dimensionality reductions, trajectory inferences or clustering results. The results of this analysis are made available through a dynamic web-app which can be shared with collaborators without requiring them to install any additional software.
